## About The Project

This project extends The Odin Project's Mini Message Board project, where the messages would reset when the server restarted, by implementing it with a PostgreSQL database and pg.


Instructions from TOP: 
* Deploy a new db on a hosting service you choose, and obtain its connection information.
* Create a messages table, populate it with data if you wish. This should be done via a script.
* Add the necessary environment variables, create a pool, and implement the required db functions.
